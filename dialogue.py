    'good_faith': 'Translation: He requires proof of good faith. We must make a contribution to his people that shows we are not a threat. Shall I blast him now, master?',

    'opportunity': 'Observation: This is a great opportunity for slaughter.',
    'thankfully': 'Observation: I am a droid, master, with programming. Even if I did not enjoy killing, I would have no choice. Thankfully, I enjoy it very much.',
    'dictionary': 'Expletive: Damn it, master, I am an assassination droid... not a dictionary!',

Statement: I mean, I have only just been re-activated, only to find out there are sub-standard duplicates of me running all over the galaxy, corroding my good name. But if they are, in fact, hunting you, then I look forward to the opportunity to meet these units - and educate them in proper assassination protocols.",
    'melodramatic': "Any time you inconvenience or jeopardize yourself for another, is a vulnerability. In any event, I feel compelled to point out that your self-destructive path of pacifism and sacrifice will only lead you to your doom. That may be a trifle melodramatic, but frankly, it is something that all Jedi should hear, and I have been rehearsing the speech for some time.",
